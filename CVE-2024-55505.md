# CVE-2024-55505: IDOR in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v.1.0 allows unauthorized engineer to view complaint tickets belonging to other engineers

## Description

An issue in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the message-view.php component.

## Steps to Reproduce (PoC)

An attacker can log in with engineer privileges or create an engineer account, as the application permits account creation with engineer-level access. After accessing a complaint ticket via http://localhost/dummy/message.php, the attacker can manipulate the URL parameter in http://localhost/dummy/message-view.php?id=<complaint-id> by altering the id value to view complaint tickets assigned to other engineers. This flaw reveals sensitive complaint information assigned by the admin, compromising data confidentiality.

## Impact

Successful exploitation allows attacker to view other engineer's complaint tickets.
