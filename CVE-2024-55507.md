# CVE-2024-55507: IDOR in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v.1.0 Enable Unauthorized Engineer Account Deletion

## Description

An issue in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v.1.0 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the delete_e.php component.

## Steps to Reproduce (PoC)

To reproduce the vulnerability, access the directory listing at http://localhost/admin/ to locate the delete_e.php endpoint. Then, navigate to http://localhost/admin/delete_e.php?id=<engineer_user-id> and modify the id parameter with different values (e.g., id=5, id=6) to delete engineer-level accounts. This endpoint can be exploited without a valid session or any privileges, as it lacks proper authentication and authorization checks. Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP with a wordlist to discover the id parameter if necessary. To verify the impact, please try logging in with the deleted accounts and confirm that the application does not have proper access controls, allowing unauthorized mass account deletion.

## Impact

Successful exploitation allows attackers to achieve Mass Account Deletion.
